h2. What is Continuators?

Continuators is a new way for you to keep your favorite TV-Series going! The world’s
favorite TV-Series sometimes get canceled because the ratings may be not good enough
for a TV-network to continue production, but still there are millions of fans all over
the world who would gladly pre-order a season pass to make future episodes possible.
Continuators makes it possible to aggregate that demand by creating a community off
fans around each project that make their intent of pre-ordering the series known to the
production companies and the series creators.

h3. All-or-nothing funding?

Every project on Continuators must be have the minimum amount of pre-orders that
we’ve set at a general $29.99 per season per series before the deadline expires.

If a series does not find enough support no one gets charged. You know the drill from
your favorite daily-deal sites: if you want to help a project reach its goal, spread the
word and let all of your friends know about it!

h3. What’s the deal?

When you register for the pre-order of a season pass you do not yet need to commit any
money or payment details to us. It might sound strange but we trust the fans to pay up,
once enough people have signed up for a series and the production companies say yes to
a new season just for us fans!

h3. What projects are featured on Continuators?

We love TV-Series and that’s what we do: series only! Continuators focuses on
renowned, world-class TV-Series that either have been canceled o rare on the verge of
being canceled.

h3. How do I buy a deal?

Found a TV-Series you want to support? Great! Just register your wish to pre-order
another season. And again: don’t worry. At this stage we want nothing but your support
and that you spread the word to your friends so that we get enough people together for
your favourite series.

If, and only if, a series reaches the required number of people wishing to pre-order the
series AND if the producers have agreed to produce another season for us, will we send
you an Email asking you to provide us with payment details and paying for your season
upfront with everybody else.

h3. If funding does not succeed do supporters pay anything?

No!

h3. Do I get notified if a series I've supported succeeds?

We’ll send you an email when the offer ends, no matter the outcome.

h3. Can I pay with a check? Send cash by mail?

Sorry, Continuators will only support credit card payments or Paypal.

h3. Can I cancel an order?

Of course. You can cancel an order fourteen days after we’ve sent you the notification
that the series has been successfully funded and you have provided payment details.

h3. Where does Continuators get the projects from?

Honestly: we just put our favourite cancelled or soon-to be-ending series on our site and
hope that enough people spread the word. Once we have enough commitments
by our community for a series we talk to the producers and show creators to see if we can
get a deal for our members.

h3. Can I recommend a series to you?

Sure. Just sent an email to myseries@continuators.com and we'll look into it and its availability.
